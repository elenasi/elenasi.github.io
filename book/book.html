                        Whence come the thou-sands of photographs used every month by newspapers and magazines?

                    <p>
                        More than that, whence do the photographs come which are used by makers of calen-dars, postcards, for
                        adverti-sements,
                        and for illustrating books, stories and articles?

                    At first thought, the answer is, "From professional photographers and publisher-photo-services." But
                    professional photographers do not produce one-third of the photographs used, and publisher-photo-services are
                    supplied by that same large number of camerists that supply publications with most of their prints.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    No one can deny that the greatest number of prints published are bought from amateur photographers in towns no
                    larger than the average, and sometimes smaller.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    The camerist does not have to get in an air-ship and fly to Africa in order to produce photographs that will
                    sell. Read what Waldon Fawcett says, himself a success at selling his photographs:

                    <p>"The photographer is apt to think that all his ambitions would be realised if only he could journey to foreign shores or to distant corners of our country; or if he could attend the spectacular events that focus the attention of the world now and then. <em>This is a delusion.

                        And more, a person does not have to be an expert photographer in order to succeed at the work. Here is what one
                        prominent writer says about it:
                    </p>
                </div>
                    <blockquote class="picture3">
                        <p>"The requirements of the field are well within the capabilities of even the beginner in photography, viz.;
                            the ability to make good negatives and good prints, the ability to recognise news-value, and a methodical
                            plan to find the market where the prints will find acceptance. The man or woman who can meet these
                            requirements should be fairly successful from the beginning, and will open up quickly new avenues of
                            special work and profit." </p>

            <div class="block-text">
                <p>
                    In short, ability to make metaphors, create lovely heroines or such is not at all necessary to the successful
                    selling of photographs to publications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Is the field overcrowded? <strong> No.</strong> If there were ten times as many persons engaged in the work
                    they could all keep themselves busy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The field—how wide is it? Get out your map of the world. The field for <em>making</em> photographs extends from
                    the top margin to the bottom, and from the left to the right. The field for <em>selling</em> photographs—which
                    is more to the point—extends over about five thousand publications which use prints; not to speak of a few
                    score of other markets.

                    And how does it pay? Please note: <q> A certain magazine once paid $100 for four prints of sundials. Anamateur,who happened to be on the spot with a kodak, made over $200 out of a head-on railroad-collision. A New York professional netted $125 from the newspaper-use of a wedding-party, of considerable local prominence, which was leaving the church after the ceremony.</q> One amateur <q>realised $300 a year for two or three years from a lucky snapshot of eight pet rabbits in a row.</q>
                 </p>
                <p>
                    A set of South-Pole photographs brought $3,000 from Leslie's and $1,000 more from the International Feature
                    Service. These all, though, are very exceptional instances. The average print sells for about three dollars.
                    But there is absolutely nothing in the world to hinder a wide-awake person with a camera from making from
                    several hundred to over
                    $3,000 a year from his prints. If he becomes a specialist he may earn as high as $5,000 or even more.
                </p>

                <p>
                    No discrimination is made between press-photographers. The person wins who "delivers the goods."

                        However, I do not mean that the instances of $200 or so for prints should be taken as the prices ordinarily
                        paid. I do not maintain that there is a fortune awaiting the man with the camera; but I do say there are
                        unlimited possibilities for salable photographs and almost an unlimited number of markets for them. But there
                        are not "barrels of money" in it, for all. A person may add appreciably to his income for having sold
                        photographs; and having developed the trade to a
                        high degree, he may cash cheques to the amount of $5,000 or more a year. But not every one. Just some. And it
                        isn't like the log and the falling off it. It's work—hard work— <strong>hard work.</strong>

                    Success at selling press-photographs does not depend on the size of the town you live in, the cost or
                    manufacture of your apparatus, or on your literary ability. It depends on you and your worship of the homaged
                    gods of success if you would sell photographs. The gift of these gods is the ability to make good.
